# Roller Coaster Rankings Visualization
This is one of projects on Codeacademy Data Science Career Path. The goal is to create several data visualizations that will give the insight into the world of roller coasters.

Rankings for the best wood and steel roller coasters from the 2013 to 2018 Golden Ticket Awards are provided in 'Golden_Ticket_Award_Winners_Wood.csv' and 'Golden_Ticket_Award_Winners_Steel.csv', respectively.
Captain Coaster is a popular site for recording roller coaster information. Data on all roller coasters documented on Captain Coaster has been accessed through its API and stored in roller_coasters.csv.

The tasks of this project are:
1. Load CSVs Golden Ticket Avard Winners (2013-2018) and inspect them.
2. Write a function that will plot the ranking of a given roller coaster over time as a line.
3. Write a function that will plot the ranking of two given roller coasters over time as lines.
4. Write a function that will plot the ranking of the top n ranked roller coasters over time as lines.
5. Write a function that plots a histogram of any numeric column of the roller coaster DataFrame.
6. Write a function that creates a bar chart showing the number of inversions for each roller coaster at an amusement park.
7. Write a function that creates a pie chart that compares the number of operating roller coasters ('status.operating') to the number of closed roller coasters ('status.closed.definitely').
8. Write a function that creates a scatter plot of two numeric columns of the roller coaster DataFrame.
9. Answer the question: What roller coaster seating type is most popular? And do different seating types result in higher/faster/longer roller coasters?
